# ImageGeneration - Summarization - Translator
This project combines the power of AI for creative image generation and efficient text processing. It leverages Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js to provide a seamless user experience for both generating images with HuggingFace Inference API's and processing text for Translation and Summarization.

## Features 

The AI image generation feature enables users to specify their preferences, including a name, prompt, and model selection. A loading indicator is displayed during the image creation process, and the completed image can be shared with the community.
The text processing functionality offers three primary services: summarization, summarization with translation, and translation. Users can submit text or URLs to obtain brief summaries or translations.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Implemented to develop a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Applied to design a visually appealing and responsive UI with a glass morphism effect.
- **Hugging Face Models**: Leveraged deep learning models to generate images from textual input.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based service used for efficient image storage and management.
- **Node.js and Express.js**: Used for backend development and creating API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: Utilized as the database to store generated images and associated information.
